Robotics class project group

Team:
Ben Dunbar, Eric Shi, Gareth Moo

Challenges:
Wall Follow, Line Follow, Parallel Park

This repository contains code for labs done on the parallax basic stamp 2 microcontroller
as well as code completed for robotic project challenges. The challenges were completed with 
arduino microcontrollers and used a boe-bot chassis. 

The wall following and parallel parking challenge solultion made use of HC SR04 sonar sensors 
and the line following solution used IR sensors to follow black duct tape.
